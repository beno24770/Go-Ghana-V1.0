# The Golden Stool (Sika Dwa Kofi)

## The Sacred Symbol of the Ashanti Nation

The **Golden Stool** (Sika Dwa Kofi in Twi) is the royal and divine throne of the Ashanti people. It is not just a seat of power—it is believed to house the **soul of the Ashanti nation**.

## The Legend

According to Ashanti oral tradition, the Golden Stool descended from the heavens in a black cloud and landed on the lap of **Osei Tutu I**, the first Asantehene (Ashanti King), around **1701**.

The high priest **Okomfo Anokye** declared that the stool contained the **sunsum** (soul) of the Ashanti nation, and that the strength and unity of the Ashanti people depended on its safety.

### Key Beliefs

- The stool is **never sat upon**—even by the king
- It is so sacred that it has its own throne and attendants
- Harming the stool is considered an attack on the entire Ashanti nation
- The stool is brought out only during the most important ceremonies

## The War of the Golden Stool (1900)

When British Governor **Sir Frederick Hodgson** demanded to sit on the Golden Stool in 1900, it sparked the famous **Yaa Asantewaa War**.

**Yaa Asantewaa**, the Queen Mother of Ejisu, led the Ashanti resistance with her legendary speech:

> "If you, the men of Ashanti, will not go forward, then we will. We, the women, will. I shall call upon my fellow women. We will fight the white men. We will fight till the last of us falls in the battlefields."

Though the British eventually won the war, they **never captured the Golden Stool**. The Ashanti successfully hid it, and it remains in Kumasi to this day.
