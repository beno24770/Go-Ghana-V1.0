# Eating Etiquette in Ghana

## The Right Hand Rule

In Ghana, it is culturally imperative to eat "swallow" foods like **Fufu**, **Banku**, and **Kenkey** with your **right hand only**. The left hand is traditionally considered unclean and is reserved for personal hygiene.

### Why This Matters

This custom is deeply rooted in Ghanaian culture and is observed across all ethnic groups. Using your left hand to eat can be seen as disrespectful, especially in traditional settings or when dining with elders.

### How to Eat Fufu Properly

1. **Wash your hands** thoroughly before the meal
2. Use only your **right hand** to pinch a small portion of fufu
3. **Roll it into a ball** between your fingers
4. **Make an indentation** with your thumb to create a "scoop"
5. **Dip it into the soup** and eat in one bite
6. **Never chew fufu** - it should be swallowed whole

## Dining with Locals

When invited to a Ghanaian home:

- **Wait for the elder** to start eating before you begin
- **Accept food with both hands** as a sign of respect
- **Finish what's on your plate** - leaving food can be seen as wasteful
- **Compliment the cook** - saying "Me da wo ase" (Thank you) is appreciated

## Restaurant Etiquette

In modern restaurants, using utensils is perfectly acceptable. However, many Ghanaians still prefer to eat traditional dishes with their hands, even in upscale settings.

## Common Dishes Eaten by Hand

- **Fufu** (pounded cassava/plantain)
- **Banku** (fermented corn dough)
- **Kenkey** (fermented corn dumpling)
- **Waakye** (rice and beans - can use hands or spoon)
- **Red Red** (bean stew - typically with spoon)

## Pro Tip for Travelers

If you're unsure, observe what locals are doing. Most Ghanaians are very understanding with foreigners and will happily teach you the proper way to eat traditional foods!
