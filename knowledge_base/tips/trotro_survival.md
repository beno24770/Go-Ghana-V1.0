# How to Survive a Trotro Ride

## What is a Trotro?

A **trotro** is a privately-owned minibus that serves as the backbone of public transportation in Ghana. They're cheap, chaotic, and an essential part of the Ghanaian experience.

## Essential Survival Tips

### 1. Always Have Small Change

The **mate** (conductor) collects fares during the ride. They often don't have change for large bills (50 GHS or 100 GHS notes). Keep coins and small bills (1, 2, 5, 10 GHS) ready.

**Pro Tip:** Break large bills at a shop before boarding.

### 2. Know Your Fare

Fares are usually fixed based on distance:
- Short trips in Accra: **2-4 GHS**
- Longer trips (e.g., Circle to Madina): **3-5 GHS**
- Cross-city trips: **5-8 GHS**

If you're unsure, listen to what others are paying or ask a fellow passenger quietly.

### 3. Boarding Strategy

- **Front seat (by driver):** Most comfortable, but you'll be asked to get out frequently to let others in/out
- **Middle rows:** Best balance of comfort and convenience
- **Back row:** Most cramped, but you can stay seated the whole ride

### 4. Communicate Your Stop

When you want to get off, say **"Alight!"** or **"Driver, next stop!"** loudly enough for the driver to hear. You can also knock on the side of the van.

Common phrases:
- **"Alight!"** = I want to get off
- **"Dropping!"** = Same as above
- **"Driver, next stop!"** = Self-explanatory

### 5. Watch Your Belongings

Trotros are generally safe, but:
- Keep bags on your lap, not on the floor
- Don't flash expensive phones or jewelry
- Be extra cautious during rush hour when it's crowded

### 6. Embrace the Chaos

Trotros don't leave until they're **completely full**. This means:
- You might wait 10-30 minutes at the station
- The mate will shout destinations to attract passengers
- You'll be squeezed in with 15+ people in a van meant for 12

**Just relax and enjoy the ride!**

## Trotro Etiquette

- **Pass money forward:** If you're in the back, hand your fare to the person in front to pass to the mate
- **Pass change back:** The mate will send your change back the same way
- **Help others:** If someone needs to get out and you're blocking them, step out to let them pass
- **No loud phone calls:** Keep conversations brief and quiet

## Safety Notes

- Avoid trotros late at night (after 10 PM)
- Don't board overcrowded trotros—wait for the next one
- If the driver is driving recklessly, get off at the next stop
- Keep emergency numbers saved: **Police: 191, Ambulance: 193**

## Alternative Options

If trotros feel too overwhelming:
- **Uber/Bolt:** Available in Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi
- **Private taxis:** More expensive but direct
- **STC/VIP buses:** For inter-city travel

## The Trotro Experience

Despite the chaos, trotros are a **cultural experience**. You'll hear the latest Ghanaian music, overhear fascinating conversations, and see the city from a local's perspective.

Many travelers say riding a trotro is when they truly felt like they "got" Ghana. Give it a try—just remember your small change!
